(Nominal) Adapton in Rust
==========================

Based on this OCaml implementation: 
 https://github.com/plum-umd/adapton.ocaml

Status
------

 - Still learning how to develop in Rust.
 - Learning from projects on Cargo:
   - Basic Data structures: https://github.com/reem/adamantium
   - Laziness: https://github.com/reem/rust-lazy
   - Memoization: https://github.com/Inspiravetion/Memoirs

TODO: Short-term
-----------------

 - Implement lazy, memoized lists.
 - Implement mergesort.
 - Implement memoized sequences.
 - Implement memoized tries.

To simplify short-term goal, will only initially handle *pure input
structures*.  Do later: Imperative input changes.
